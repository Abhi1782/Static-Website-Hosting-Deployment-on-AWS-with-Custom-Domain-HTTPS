# 🌐 Static Website Hosting & Deployment on AWS with Custom Domain & HTTPS

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end hosting and deployment of a static website on AWS using multiple integrated services — EC2 (Ubuntu + Nginx), Route 53, S3, CloudFront, and Certbot SSL for HTTPS.

The website is accessible globally over HTTPS, mapped with a custom domain purchased from a hosting provider, and optimized for performance using AWS CloudFront CDN.
Additionally, static assets (like images) are served securely from Amazon S3.
